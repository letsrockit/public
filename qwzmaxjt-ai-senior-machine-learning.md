## AI (Senior, Machine Learning)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are a data-driven financial technology company. In our quest to build a better financial world, one of our key goals is to revolutionize the credit system by creating a more holistic, accurate, and democratic alternative to existing credit scoring methods. This is what our Machine Learning Engineers work on. They build—from prototype through to production—the credit and fraud models that decide who we lend to. The Machine Learning Engineer is a new position within the Data Science team that will focus on developing production services to support the models and allow them to make decisions in real time.

### What you'll do
+	Build production machine learning models; your models will decide who we lend to in real time, and how we interact with our existing customers
+	Develop the core decisioning service supporting our machine learning models in production
+	Optimize the decisioning service with respect to the accuracy of the underlying models, the latency of different 3rd party data sources, and the expected financial cost of those data sources
+	Develop our understanding of new data sources and how they may improve our existing processes
+	Work closely with company’s credit, risk, and analytics teams to understand our risk modeling strategy and the business drivers underlying that strategy

### What we look for
+	Deep understanding and experience with data engineering, data analysis, and statistical modeling, in the development of a real-time service
+	Strong proficiency writing production-quality code, preferably industry engineering experience with machine learning projects (e.g. recommendation, ranking, optimization)
+	Ability to work efficiently both solo and as part of a team; willingness to learn new things
+	Passion and drive to change consumer banking for the better, while developing a deeper understanding of applied machine learning

### Why choose us?
At our company we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say "I trust my bank to look out for me". It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem.We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.
