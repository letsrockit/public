### Overview
Think an Airbnb for storage space, where others pay for your empty space (i.e. garage or vacant room) for someone else's storage. We are creating a marketplace for both consumers and the hosts to interact. They are building a logistics and reservation system for storage in a two-sided marketplace. To create a seamless customer and host onboarding platform, they want to use key features in their app such as 1) an efficient payment system, 2) internal inbox/messaging tool and calendaring system for hosts and customers to interact, 3) and augmented reality camera for self-onboarding.
