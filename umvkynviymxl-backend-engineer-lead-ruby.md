## Backend Engineer (Lead, Ruby) 
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company begins with the world’s largest collection of artist shops. A shirt with an evil cat. An iPhone case with a hipster pirate. Whatever your thing, we have an uncommon design that smacks you right in the heart. (All available on nearly 60 products.) As for us? We’re passionate, imaginative, and a little offbeat. An inspired mix that’s helped us grow revenues more than 50% in just the past year. (We’re also nice, well-balanced folks with lives outside of work.)  Founded in Melbourne, Australia, our company now has main offices in the Central Business District of Melbourne, the SOMA area of San Francisco, and our newest in Berlin, Germany.  

We have started a new engineering team in SF! This hands-on opportunity is 30% Product Manager and 70% full stack software developer. Come be a part of the future of marketing technology at our company - your code just may help an artist pay their rent!
