## Senior DevOps Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
Millions of people don’t have access to the credit they deserve. Their options for borrowing money are unfair and limited, and it’s easy to become trapped in a downward debt spiral.

Our first product is an alternative to payday loans that provides an opportunity to access credit at lower interest rates over time which furthers company's goal of improving financial literacy and providing customers with an opportunity to build their credit scores. Our second product, the L Card, is a credit card (currently in beta) that provides best-in-class technology to a customer group that’s often overlooked.

We are continuing to build the next generation of dignified financial products that we all deserve — giving us back our time, money and control of our financial well-being.
