## Frontend Engineer (Senior, Javascript / React / Ethereum)
#### Santa Clara, CA

### Overview
We have many frontend and backend tasks and although our UI/UX designer will be providing all of the mockups and assets, there will be circumstances that require personal judgement and adaptability. The application runs on a semi-serverless architecture, so it uses the blockchain and IPFS. The frontend has a lot of intelligence in it, since blockchain resources are scarce. We like hackers, so if you are a quick learner and creative with technology, we want to talk to you. 
This is an opportunity to build the future of knowledge sharing! If you don’t have any experience with Ethereum and/or IPFS, please put together a project using them on your own and present it to us. It doesn’t have to be super fancy, we just need people who can demonstrate commitment and competence with our technology stack. Please also send us a portfolio.
