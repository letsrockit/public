## Frontend Engineer (Lead)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We seek to fundamentally change how K-12 classrooms around the world use technology. Education technology is increasingly fragmented across various applications, software, and services. This undermines the utility of technology for educators, leading to cognitive overload, frustration, and ultimately rejection. As a result, technological innovation remains locked out of the classroom.
Weâ€™re empowering the next generation of K-12 classrooms, through a classroom system helping teachers integrate all content, curriculum, communication and analytics; think Slack for classrooms. We enable teachers to access the apps/tools they need, through a unified platform tackling a fragmented $69 billion market. Students can view their work, reports and recommendations on their own dashboard.
To tackle this challenge, we are seeking an experienced Lead Front-end Developer: someone who will be both an individual contributor and technical lead / mentor, taking over the goal of replacing all our legacy code with idiomatic, tested, and maintainable React/Redux components.
