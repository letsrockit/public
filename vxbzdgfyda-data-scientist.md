## Data Scientist
#### San Carlos, CA

Predictive modeling is central to us. Underwriting more accurately and using variables that no other lender considers are what allow us to give people the rates they deserve, which in turn gives our business its biggest competitive advantage. We're looking for someone to join our data team and help change how creditworthiness is assessed. Because our challenges are so new, this person will need to have strong creative problem solving skills, in addition to a background in statistics. Experience with consumer credit is preferred but not required.

### Requirements
+	Rigorous quantitative background (graduate-level study preferred)
+	Experience with R and/or Python
+	Comfort with programming
+	Predictive modeling experience strongly preferred

We understand that this is a suboptimal user experience.  We are, for various reasons, unable to publicize the companies we work with, so we've
created a **private un-anonymized repository** which is much more informative on who these companies are and what they're hiring for.
