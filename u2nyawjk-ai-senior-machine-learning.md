##  AI (Senior, Machine Learning)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our recommendations algorithms are a central part of company’s product and one of the biggest drivers of new book discoveries. This team works on a variety of features including, recommendations, search, payments and the mobile app API, using a wide variety of technologies including Ruby on Rails, Go, ElasticSearch, Hadoop (Spark, Hive, Cassandra), MySQL, Sphinx, and Redis.
Our team boasts several recent accomplishments such as adding millions of cross content recommendations through topic extraction, and a fuzzy matching text filter that can instantly detect two similar, but not identical, passages of text out of a database of all the books in the world. Pretty neat, right?
Here’s where you come in. Our team is working on the book equivalent of Pandora's "Music Genome Project": an ambitious project to organize all the books in the world and use it to take book discovery to the next level which means we are building the world's best recommendation engine for books.
