## AI (Lead, Machine Learning)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our mission is to build smart, flying robots. We use tools like drones, cameras, and IoT sensors to capture the physical world and create structured data which can be fed into machine learning models.
The ultimate application is to build the Automated Jobsite of the Future. This involves automating heavy machinery, analyzing productivity and efficiency of assets on construction and mining sites; building driverless UAV inspection solutions; and bringing all of these applications to disconnected remote sites with our on-the-edge devices.

### What youâ€™ll do
+	Architect our AI pipeline infrastructure focusing on deploying on our edge platform
+	Oversee and develop practical, scalable, and production-ready solutions using ML models alongside the AI team
+	Work with other engineering teams (Product Engineering, Infrastructure, Hardware/Firmware, etc) to integrate AI modules into production environment to produce a complete turnkey solution
+	Build the AI platform following the Core Tenets of our AI team

### What we look for
+	A leader who is not afraid of calling the elephant in the room
+	A champion and supporter of a diverse team
+	With industry experience deploying production-ready machine learning systems. Some areas we are interested in: AI in the wild; AI platforms deployed and used at scale; Federated learning on multiple edge devices
+	Hands on experience with: ML libraries and DL libraries (e.g. TensorFlow, Theano, Keras); Computer Vision libraries (e.g. OpenCV); Ingesting non-IP based protocols (e.g. Modbus, BACnet); Large-scale infrastructure (e.g. Spark, Mesos, Akka)
+	Worked on a range of machine learning problems in different industries
+	Believer in different machine learning approaches
+	Excited to mentor and develop the technical skills of other team members
+	Enthusiastic about working with a global team
+	Passionate about our mission!
