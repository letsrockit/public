+ Improve code quality by writing unit tests.
+ Perform code reviews.
+ Participate in brainstorming sessions and contribute ideas to our technology, algorithms, and services.
+ Work with the product and design teams to understand end­user requirements, formulate use cases, and then translate those into pragmatic and effective technical solutions.
+ Dive into difficult challenges and successfully deliver results on schedule.
+ Maintain and improve best practices to keep services up and running and detect issues before they become tangible.

### What we look for
+ 3–7 years of hands­on coding and software design.
+ Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a related field.
+ A track record of projects completed on time.
+ Ability to solve challenging problems.
+ Solid knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and System Design - you should know how to create software that’s extensible, reusable, and meets desired architectural objectives.
