## Frontend Engineer (Lead, React)
#### San Mateo, CA

### Overview
Our company started with a clear vision: make modern data warehousing effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users. Because traditional on-premises and cloud solutions struggle with this, we developed an innovative product with a new built-for-the-cloud architecture that combines the power of data warehousing, the flexibility of big data platforms, and the elasticity of the cloud at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions. 
Our goal is to enable data scientists to prepare and visualize data, data engineers to create data pipelines to load their data and business analysts to easily gain insight. The out-of-the-box user experience provides an onboarding experience for a new customer to get started while the administrative experience allows for securing, managing and monitoring the infrastructure.
