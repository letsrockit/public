### Overview
 We are a scrappy early-stage robotics startup based in San Francisco. We design, build, and operate autonomous urban delivery robots. In San Francisco alone, hundreds of thousands of packages are delivered every day. Over half of the world’s population lives in cities at least this big. Robotic delivery will improve reliability and drastically reduce the cost of delivery, touching the lives of billions of people and ultimately transforming how the world works. Our team is small and we’re moving lightning fast to create the world’s first fleet of autonomous delivery robots to solve this Earth-scale problem. 

### Job Description
Behaviors and motion control are central capabilities for safe and efficient package delivery. As the Motion Planning lead you will design and implement planners and behaviors to route thousands of vehicles past people, traffic, and construction on city streets. These planners will operate in a variety of environments, from off-board route planning to real-time control during delivery. We’re looking for a planning lead who has experience developing and implementing route and motion planning systems in dynamic and varied environments in real-world environments. As the lead, you will build and deploy the initial architecture of the planning system. 

### What we look for
+ Project or real-world experience with field-deployed planning systems on a mobile robot or other substantial system
+ Fluency in C / C++
+ Demonstrated ability to create realtime motion planning algorithms
+ Understanding of a variety of planning techniques (A*, D*, RRTs, etc.)
+ Extensive experience with programming and algorithm design

### Bonus Points 
+ Masters or PhD in computer science or related degree
+ Significant contributions to geometric- and/or sampling-based planning algorithms
+  Experience with autonomous robots
+ Knowledge of computer vision techniques and machine learning
+ Experience with pose estimation, SLAM, probabilistic filtering, and 3D data
