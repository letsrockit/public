## Mobile Engineer (Senior, Android)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We build respiration sensing wearables that take bio-sensing beyond step tracking. Our product changes lives.

Our sensor continuously and accurately tracks respiratory parameters (such as inhalation and exhalation time, apneic events, etc.) and activity (steps, gait, posture) in real time, streaming raw data to a smartphone, and ultimately to our infrastructure. Each day we collect, store, and process over 10 billion data points.

You’ll be the key lead on our Android app team. We ship hardware, firmware, and mobile apps that work seamlessly in concert with a small and dedicated team. This is a role for a generalist who isn't afraid of the technical complexity of real-time connected devices, advanced ML algos and complex health applications.
