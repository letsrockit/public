## Fullstack Frontend Developer
#### Redwood City, CA

## Quick Summary
Our company’s software provides Internet access and applications for the largest, most diverse Internet service providers around the world, providing products that range from internet connectivity to providing innovative security solutions and messaging that reaches more than 500 million consumers each day, and that number is growing.

Our platform provides internet connectivity for all subscribers; we protect subscribers from botnets; networks from DNS DDOS attacks; our Engage applications provide subscriber safety from phishing and malware downloads as well as the ability to mediate Internet access controlled by subscribers, and we’re hiring. We have very ambitious (maybe a little crazy) goals, so there will be plenty of opportunities to tackle stimulating technical problems using the most cutting edge technologies available. If you’re interested in consumer facing web applications that reach millions of subscribers, data visualization, big data analytics, complex rules engines, or building the distributed systems scale to support all of this for our subscriber base, we should talk. As we grow, we’re being very careful not to lose our culture. If you want to work in a collegial environment where you can be a part of a small, dynamic engineering team and where you can really take ownership of a project, you’ll probably fit in just fine. At our company, attitudes are forbidden, and ideas are championed.

We have great customers and reach, so the company has huge opportunities, but we’ve been able to avoid the endless meetings and bureaucratic hoops that large companies have just to get simple things done. And we have all the good parts of a small start-up with a product that is growing fast, needs scale, and innovative new features.  At our company, things move fast. We have to be agile and responsive without losing sight of the bigger picture.

### What you'll do
+	Design and build consumer and ISP facing web applications that power the next generation ISP relationship with their subscribers. Applications include providing sophisticated messaging applications (both the definition of campaigns as well as consumer facing experiences), data analytics for both subscribers and administrators.
+	Own one of these applications from cradle to release and continuous improvement.  The focus here is to be ‘smart’ and ‘get things done’.  We need to continually add new features and capabilities to our products to take advantage of the opportunities.
+	Work with Product Managers to understand business needs and propose technical solutions to meet them.

### What we look for
+	Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science
+	Java, C++ or equivalent experience in production environments
+	Exposure to architectural patterns of a large, high-scale web application
+	Exceptional proficiency using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/AJAX (e.g. use of Bootstrap or Angular is useful)
+	Demonstrated design and UX sensibilities
+	Experience building and delivering a true ‘product’ with multiple releases, etc.
+	Proficient with object oriented programming, test driven development and continuous improvement.

### Bonus Points
+	Ability to learn and adapt quickly in a dynamic environment.
+	Experience in short release cycles, Agile/Lean XP, and TDD
+	Experience with SQL or NOSQL databases
