## Search Engineer (Senior)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are looking for a Senior Search Engineer who can hit the ground running. You’ll take ownership of the design and implementation of our consumer-facing search. As part of our engineering team, you will release code every day and your work will be seen by millions of users.
Each engineer has a role in building our architecture and will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the stack. Our projects are big - terabytes of data - and users are around the world. However, our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish and work closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.

### What you’ll do
+	You’ll improve the relevancy and functionality of our consumer-facing search by combining the capabilities of Elasticsearch with the application of Machine Learning techniques over our vast dataset.  
+	You’ll be designing and implementing high performance and scalable search systems, indexing over 16 million pieces of content in every conceivable format for every academic subject.
+	You'll be taking us global as we scale our site for 10x to 100x as many students who can access our resources for any course, anywhere, at any time, and in any language.
+	You’ll work with our engineering, product, and design teams to build new features, tools and functionality with AWS, Docker, React, Elasticsearch, and other tools in our stack.
+	You’ll leverage Elasticsearch to help solve problems beyond user-facing search - these include recommendations, duplicate/copyright detection, and natural language understanding applications.

### What we look for
+	You've gained 4-5+ years of professional experience with web application development and MVC frameworks like Symfony, Rails, or Django.
+	You have back-end development experience in languages such as Javascript in Node.js, Python, Ruby, Scala, Go, PHP, C#, or Haskell.
+	You have 2-3 years of recent search-specific experience with search engines such as Elasticsearch, Solr, or Lucene.
+	You've earned a degree in Computer Science or STEM field.
+	You have code you can share through a project website or GitHub repo.

### Bonus points
+	You have experience in leading or mentoring less-experienced engineers.
+	You have front end development or design experience with jQuery, React, JavaScript, or SASS.
+	You have data analysis and visualization experience (e.g. for Machine Learning).

### Perks
+	Industry competitive salary and stock options
+	Full coverage (medical, dental, vision, and life)
+	401(k) program to help you save for the future
+	Educational assistance program to support lifelong learning
+	Free weekly lunches, plus an endless snack and drink supply
+	Regularly planned team and company events, alongside awesome teammates
+	Commuter benefits, cell-phone allowance, and a free gym membership
+	Opportunity to make a meaningful impact in a revolutionary space
