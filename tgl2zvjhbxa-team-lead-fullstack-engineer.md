## Team Lead, Fullstack
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We’re changing the world of data connectivity. Our technology unites the marketing technology ecosystem, enabling brands to measure the impact of digital marketing on sales and deliver highly relevant messages to consumers on virtually any channel or device.

As a Team Lead, Full Stack, you’ll be responsible to help engineers develop new skills and advance their careers. You should have a track record of leading productive engineering teams and have at least 1+ years of engineering management experience.

In the first six months of this role, you will start out as an individual contributor, learning our web development technologies, contributing to the development of full stack applications, and forming close working relationship with your teammates in engineering. Once you have a good foundation of the projects here you will take on a new challenge and transition into a management position, leading and coaching a team of full stack software engineers.

On the engineering team we value ownership and individual contribution within a collaborative environment. Be ready to leave your ego at the door, roll up your sleeves and start solving huge challenges as soon as you begin.

### Job Description
+	Add major features to existing applications and build new ones.
+	Quickly grow (within your first year) to manage and mentor a team of high-achieving engineers.
+	Be at the forefront of technology innovation. Keep us on the cutting edge of industry tools and best practices.
+	Push your teammates to become stronger engineers. They will do the same for you.
+	Take our engineering, business development and culture in a whole new direction during one of our four Hackweeks every year.
+	Contribute towards building a great company.

### Qualifications
+	3+ years experience building high quality, performant and scalable web applications.
+	Expertise in working with all aspects of an application; you’re just as comfortable building user interfaces as you are designing and implementing the data models and infrastructure that power them.
+	Experience with mentoring (or managing) people. Previous experience in a team lead role is ideal.
+	Expertise in web development technologies such as Rails, Backbone.js or React or the brains and brawn to become an expert.
+	Good diagnostic and debugging sense, the ability to find a needle in a haystack (or a bug in a program stack.)
+	Have a startup personality: smart, ethical, friendly, hard-working and proactive.
+	You lead by example, by setting the right context and by helping teammate do their best work.
