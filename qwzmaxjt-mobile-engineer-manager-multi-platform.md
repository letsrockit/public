## Mobile Engineer (Manager, Multi-platform)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company is a data-driven financial technology company. Machine learning is core to our decision making processes, from validating identities and detecting fraud, to credit underwriting and servicing. We seek to revolutionize the credit system by building higher quality alternatives to incumbent systems and methods.

### Job Description
On this role, you will lead our company’s native app development teams. You will work closely with senior product managers, technical leads, and executives to determine a product roadmap, translate the roadmap into technical specs, and execute the plan.
The Android and iOS teams work on separate native codebases, but are in close coordination to maintain feature and UX parity, along with our web apps.  In addition to existing functionality, you will be responsible for the successful planning, delivery and maintenance of the next generation app products and features.

### What you'll do
+ Lead the two app engineering teams by coordinating with tech leads and individual contributors
+ Own and drive complex technical projects from the planning stage through execution
+ Provide guidance on architecture, design, and defining processes for launching products and features
+ Help set the direction for the future of Mobile development, including exploration and implementation of better code sharing techniques across native apps and web (a la React Native).
+ Provide mentoring to both junior and senior engineers in their progress on business and personal career goals

### What we look for
+ Passion and drive to change consumer finance for the better
+ Prior people management experience (e.g., hiring, performance management, etc.) and relevant work experience building a consumer product service
+ Expert knowledge in at least one native mobile platform and its associated tools, spanning the full development stack of building custom designed user interfaces, networking API integration, logging, testing, and monitoring
+ Ability to pick up new technologies quickly
+ Emphasis on writing clear, readable, testable, deployable, monitored code for mobile applications

### Why choose us?
At our company, we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.

We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say "I trust my bank to look out for me". It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem.

We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.
