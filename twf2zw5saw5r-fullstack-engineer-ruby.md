## Fullstack Engineer (Ruby) 
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We reinvent the way the world conducts business online. We empower businesses to understand their productivity and provide the advanced project management, resource planning, collaboration, and financial tools necessary to strategically improve profitability - all in one place. By combining these tools, we’re replacing cumbersome and expensive business processes that are currently handled by a hodge-podge of spreadsheets, aging competitors, and repetitive human tasks. We believe that every business deserves a chance to succeed in today’s distributed economy.

### What we look for
We’re looking for senior engineers who enjoy teaching and learning from others. You are passionate about writing maintainable, reusable, well-tested code. You enjoy pairing and applying TDD when appropriate. You don’t shy away from diving into a large (but very well tested!) Rails application to refactor it into components and services. You’re excited to work on a team creating intuitive UIs in Backbone. Marionette and CoffeeScript, developing reusable JSON APIs, and extracting and releasing open source components.
It’s hard to measure experience in years meaningfully, but you should have a strong background in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, as well as JavaScript and ideally CoffeeScript. We’d expect something on the order of 4+ years of full-time Ruby experience.
Experience in the following would help you get up to speed and start committing on day one:
+ RSpec and Jasmine
+ CoffeeScript
+ Sass and modular CSS
+ Backbone / Backbone.Marionette
+ API design

### Why choose us?
We have a complex product and we’ve built a technology stack that allows for continuous deployment with nearly zero downtime. Every engineer majors in code and minors in product, so we all love working through data designs as well as complex user interactions. Whether its through pair-programming, flexible roles, or our obsession for quality, test-driven code, our engineers (from grasshopper to black belt) are always learning.
