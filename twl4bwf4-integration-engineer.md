### What are you looking for in a team member?
Your specialization is less important than your ability to learn fast and adapt to shifting technologies. We’re especially fond of people who:

+	Focus on project goals, not just writing code.
+	Iterate until customers love what you’ve built, and pay for it.
+	Have a hacker mindset and master the fine art of balancing time, features, and quality of code. You know when to unit test and when to “just ship it”.
+	Strive to grow personally and professionally, beyond just expanding technical abilities.
+	Love to experiment with new technology and share knowledge with the team.
+	Represent the team and product at conferences.

If you are a member of an under-represented group in technology, we strongly encourage you to apply.
