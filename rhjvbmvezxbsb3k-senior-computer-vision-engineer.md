## Senior Computer Vision Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Job Description:
We are the leading cloud software platform for commercial drones, making the power of aerial data accessible and productive for everyone. Trusted by businesses and individuals in over 130 countries worldwide, we are transforming the way drone users collect, manage and digest impactful data in a variety of industries, including agriculture, real estate, mining and construction. Simple by design and easy to use, our company builds revolutionary software compatible with any drone. If you’re excited about drones and want to help us create a simple and seamless experience for drone users across the world, we’d love to hear from you!

### The Challenge
We are a small team of highly skilled photogrammetry developers working on a scalable image processing platform that efficiently processes drone imagery to geo-reference, align, stitch, blend, ortho-rectify and reconstruct - creating tens of thousands of point clouds, 3D models and mosaics a month. That data is used to drive high ROI decisions in industry as diverse as construction, agriculture, mining, conservation, forestry, and infrastructure inspection. We are looking for senior computer vision engineers that can join us. We are looking for C++ developers who consider themselves experts. We solve difficult photogrammetry problems.

We are building a state of the art photogrammetry pipeline that can take aerial images and quickly create high-resolution data products. We Process 100,000s of images into these data products. Want to operate at a larger scale. Be more accurate, faster, and able to service more industries. Thee Candidate would join a small (2) team to build this kind of technology through Geometric Computer Vision. We want to be the best in the world.

Some time spent on feature work (making the product more robust), some time spent on performance (making the product faster and better, while using fewer resources).

### Qualifications:
+	Strong academic foundations from a competitive university/laboratory, with focus on computer vision and photogrammetry (M.S./Ph.D. preferred)
+	3+ years of experience working in applied photogrammetry technology.
+	3+ years of experience developing in C++.
+	Strong applied math skills in linear algebra, 2D/3D geometry, and numerical methods (polynomial/Fourier approximations, ordinary differential equations, linear & non-linear optimizations, error analysis, etc.)
+	Experience with structure-from-motion algorithms covering central/non-central camera models, bundle adjustment, multi-view stereo, structure from shading
+	Experience working in SLAM, dense point cloud, meshing, texturing, Algorithm development, and optimization
+	MUST HAVE: Multi-view stereo experience (current teams specialize in structure from motion, so that experience isn’t as critical for us)

### Bonus Points:
+	Experience with any of the following
  + Neural networks
  + Deep learning
  + Machine learning
  + GPU Programming
  + CUDA

### Life with us
