## Backend Engineer (Senior, Python)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company is building the world’s first sustainable transit service from scratch. Two years after launching our first route in San Francisco, we now get thousands of Californians and Texans to work every day on 40+ different routes. Nearly 100% of those riders use our iOS or Android app to ride. Ford Smart Mobility is investing heavily in us and wants us to play a big part in the future of Ford. Sound exciting?

### Job Description
The Senior Backend Engineer will play a lead role in architecting, implementing and deploying our systems, tools, and services. We're building all of our systems from the ground up so they are agile and we can move fast. Our riders and drivers depend on our systems every day, and you'll play a central role in bringing it to the masses. As a core member of a cross-functional team comprised of engineers, PMs, designers and data scientists you will work collaboratively to build new products and support our existing ones. You will also collaborate with the product management team in both analyzing requirements and defining the end product.

+ More than 4 years of demonstrated experience building, testing and shipping commercially available software products
+ RESTful API design
+ Architecting software and cloud infrastructure at scale
+ Relational and key-value data stores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis
+ Impressive scale
+ Experience with AWS
+ Knowledge of a variety of languages is desired and encouraged: Python, Ruby, Go, Java, C/C++ and others
+ Knowledge of mapping technologies
+ Unit and Integration testing

### Why choose us?
Our mission is to become the world's first sustainable mass transit service by crowdsourcing a network of commuter shuttle routes that provides a fast, reliable and affordable service using new Ford Transit 15-passenger vans. When a critical mass of future riders 'vote' for a particular route, we launch its service, typically between popular residential and work areas — as well as transit hubs like commuter rail stations, ferry terminals and bus depots — providing commutes in half the time as public transit and a fraction the cost of ridesharing.

Founded in 2014 in SF, we have expanded to Austin, TX and has over 50 routes, providing tens of thousands of rides per week. The company participated in Y Combinator's Winter 2015 batch and was acquired by Ford Smart Mobility in September 2016. As a cornerstone of Ford's urban mobility strategy, our company has the mandate and resources to scale its concept worldwide, and will expand to at least another 5 markets worldwide this year.
