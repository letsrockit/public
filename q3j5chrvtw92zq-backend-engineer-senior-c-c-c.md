It is a fundamentally different approach to data security which is why our investors, advisors, customers, and (obviously) us too, are all very excited about it. 

### Job Description
We are looking for the best and the brightest back-end developers to work on our platform and API.

A few requirements include experience with:
+ Highly distributed systems
+ TCP/IP
+ Server-side programming
+ Data access/control/manipulation
+ Linux and other operating systems

NOTE: Security and/or file storage experience a plus but not required
You will be one of our first 10 hires, so your code will be laying the foundation for us.

### Qualifications
+ 4-8 years or work experience
+ BA/BS degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience.
+ C, C++Screen, Linux, API, TCP/IP, Distributed Systems, Enterprise Software, Microsoft Windows
