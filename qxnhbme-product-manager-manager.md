## Product Manager (Manager)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
The PM team works cross-functionally to help build out our vision. We’re responsible for our product from strategy to execution, and we work alongside our designers, engineers, founders, user operations team, sales team, marketing team, and other PMs to build a great product. We drive more than the work: From leading the team to setting the team’s roadmap, we take part in every step of development, launching, and beyond.

### Job Description
As a manager on the PM team, you’ll focus on developing the excellent product managers around you. You are passionate about helping others contribute more and develop as leaders. You should be as enthusiastic about recruiting and building a team as you are about setting strategy, building a roadmap, and solving real customer needs. You’ll bring the confidence, clarity, and wisdom that come from broad experience leading high-caliber teams that build complex, customer-focused software.

### What you'll do
+ Manage 3-5 members of the product management team
+ Serve as an individual-contributor product manager on a feature team
+ Own the success of a year-long product objective. This includes crafting a vision, setting strategy, guiding roadmaps, and reviewing product work

### What we look for
+ Years of relevant hands-on experience in product management and people management
+ Enthusiastic about empowering others and helping people grow their careers
+ Excellent communicator who listens carefully and creates clarity
+ Have a track record of shipping successful customer-centric products at scale
+ Collaborative and confident: You’ve learned from your experiences and synthesized that learning into frameworks, but you’re still open to new ways of doing things
+ Strategic systems thinker: You see how the smaller pieces fit into the big picture
+ Excellent product design skills: You have an eye for details and a high quality bar
+ Excited to go after hard problems and solve them
