## Principal Platform Engineer
#### Redwood City, CA

### Quick Summary
We have been building the backbone of the internet for more than a decade. Our software is used by dozens of Internet service providers around the world, reaching more than 500 million subscribers each day, and that number is growing all the time.

We’re in the process of expanding as we become a complete internet experience company, and we’re hiring. We have very ambitious (maybe a little crazy) goals for the next few years, so there will be plenty of opportunities to tackle stimulating technical problems using the most cutting edge technologies available. If you’re interested in big data analytics or complex rules engines, we should talk. As we grow, we’re being very careful not to lose our culture. If you want to work in a collegial environment where you can be a part of a small, dynamic engineering team and where you can really take ownership of a project, you’ll probably fit in just fine. At our company, attitudes are forbidden, and ideas are championed.

We’re in the process of expanding as we become a total complete internet experience company, and we’re hiring. We have all the good parts of an established company, without the endless meetings and bureaucratic hoops to jump through just to get simple things done. And we’ve got all the good parts of a small start-up, except we have a better health benefits, more flexible schedules, and a saner work-life balance. At our company, things move fast. We have to be agile and responsive without losing sight of the bigger picture. We’ve got a plan to make the internet more awesome.
