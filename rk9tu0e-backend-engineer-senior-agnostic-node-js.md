## Backend Engineer (Senior, Agnostic / node.js)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Spend your day hacking and modeling the sophisticated behavior of open source build systems and package managers like Gradle, Maven, YARN, pip, npm, go get, and more. On a small team, you will design opinionated systems in a variety of languages (JS-heavy) to analyze, graph and understand the universe of software packages, dependencies and builds at large scale. With a passion for seamlessly integrating and automating systems, you will design integrations and plugins into the developer workflow to solve substantial problems in a painless user experience.
