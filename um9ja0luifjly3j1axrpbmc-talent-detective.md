### Overview
Founded in 2011, our company partners with Bay Area start-ups and a few amazing large tech companies to help them build their engineering teams.  How do we do it?  What makes us different?

We are located in SOMA, and we work hard to integrate ourselves into the engineering community. We visit the office of every client and our weekly stats focus on coffees and lunches with candidates to generate referrals. We sponsor hackathon teams, client events, and host regular happy hours.  

### Job Description
Our business model is built around full desk recruiting.  On a daily basis, our recruiters source, search, call, arrange interviews, get feedback, give interview prep, visit clients and more.  Our success has led to many client referrals, which is a good thing, but we need to continue delivering!

### What you'll do
For the first few months you will be learning about technology, the start-up landscape, recruiting, recruiting tools, platforms to find engineers, and growing your network.  What does this actually mean?
+ Partner with Senior Recruiters to learn their clients and do targeted sourcing and searching
+ Identify and target companies where engineers are leaving, a.k.a build our Hitlist
+ Use tools like our ATS, LinkedIn, Github, Meetup, StackOverflow, Boolean  X-ray searches, sourcing.io etc. to build pipelines
+ Research and find your own most effective recruiting tools
+ Attend weekly start-up events to learn about technology, meet engineers and represent our company
+ Build saved searches to constantly be aware of any engineers coming onto the job market
+ Data entry (it isn’t glamorous, but it’s part of the job) to continue building our database

### What we look for
+ Amazing Attention To Detail (ATD), solid organization skills, and an ability to prioritize when every day has more tasks than 24 hours can handle
+ Strong interest in technology and start-ups
+ Knowledge of productivity tools and ways to research online
+ Either recruiting/sales experience, a technical background, or start-up experience is a plus (Have more than 1 of these? Even better!)
