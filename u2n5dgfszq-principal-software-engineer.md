## Principal Software Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company was started in 2017 by seasoned engineers from Amazon Web Services, Duo Security, Google, Okta, PagerDuty, and Splunk who want to help enterprise engineers securely and easily build identity-driven, large-scale distributed software systems. We are breathing life into some select ideas we saw unlock innovation and speed at not only these companies, but also at other large-scale, global Internet companies.
With the rise of cloud computing, software "containers," and distributed, service-oriented engineering teams, software developers, IT operations managers, and security engineers are being challenged to operate effectively in an increasingly complex and fragmented enterprise IT environment. To help, we are building a set of distinct but well-integrated set of software components that enable disparate enterprise software systems to more easily and securely communicate with each other, even as said systems span across heterogeneous IT environments and platforms.
We believe our deep commitment to building and maintaining open source software (OSS) combined with simple (but powerful) products that are usable will drive our success and create a sizeable and lasting impact. Our first step towards this end is the OSS project called SPIFFE, which is catalyzing a standard, tooling, and an ecosystem around the service identity concept.

### Job Description
We seek a Principal Software Engineer who will contribute at a senior level to software architecture and implementation and will help mentor and grow our engineering team. This role is hands on – you’ll get to design and code along with performing code reviews, provide mentorship, and plan team assignments. Our prerequisites are simple. You have a strong passion for software development and take pride in your coding. You should also have excellent analytical skills and the ability to handle complex, modular software development in a collaborative, team-based environment. We care more about your attitude and aptitude than the specific tools and technologies you have used in the past. We strongly prefer teammates who seek forgiveness rather than permission, too.
You'll be a full-time employee with full-time benefits, including competitive salary and stock options. While many of our full-time teammates are across the globe, we prefer you to predominantly work from our office in San Francisco, California, USA.

### What you’ll do
+	Building reusable code and libraries to be used in both OSS and commercial offerings.
+	Interacting and participating in SPIFFE activities, including special interest groups (SIGs).
+	Architecting components of SPIRE (SPIFFE’s reference implementation).
+	Delivering internal and external technical presentations.

### What we look for
+	You are fluent in the following:
  +	OS: Linux (and, ideally, some grounding in Windows).
  +	Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.
  +	Protocols: (Lower) IP, TCP, and UDP; (Higher) HTTP.
  +	Languages: Go, C/C++, Python and/or Java
+	You have built products using test-driven development and service-oriented architecture design patterns.
+	You have first-hand experience tackling the challenges related to continuous delivery models for the cloud (i.e. monitoring, zero downtime, back-ups, global redundancy, etc).
+	You have designed and documented APIs (straightforward, unsurprising, and defensible).
+	You are obsessed with shipping, code coverage/testing, and usability.
+	You have improved engineering practices.

### Bonus Points
+	10+ years of experience across software architecture and/or engineering.
+	Experience developing and deploying upon Kubernetes, OpenStack, and/or Mesos.
+	Contributed to OSS projects.
+	Experience in growing and leading security research teams and presenting findings at conferences.
+	BA/BS in computer science and/or a related technical field.
+	Experience with any of the following:
  +	PKI (x.509 certificates, etc.)
  +	Widely used crypto protocols (TLS, GPG, SSH)
  +	Authentication (OAuth, SAML, etc)
  +	Code signing
  +	Kernel exploitation and remediation
  +	Network security and engineering
