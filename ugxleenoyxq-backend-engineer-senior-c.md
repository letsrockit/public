+ Experience writing high performance code (throughput, latency) and optimizing it (profiling, identifying bottlenecks, etc) ­  
+ Experience authoring and debugging multithreaded code (usage of atomic instructions, using mutexes, avoiding mutexes, reasoning about race conditions and deadlocks) 
+ Experience with code generation (templating engines, parsers, grammars, compiler toolchains, etc)
