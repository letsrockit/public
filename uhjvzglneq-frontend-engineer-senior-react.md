## Frontend Engineer (Senior, React)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are a venture-backed startup building the future for car buying. We're a fun-loving, hard working group of dreamers who believe anything is possible with the right team.
In addition to having more product demand than we can handle, we've raised three rounds of funding with top investors in the valley including SV Angel, 8VC, Battery Ventures, Crunchfund as well as numerous automotive industry veterans.
This is the perfect chance to get in early at a fast paced startup with the chance to make a big impact. If changing one of the world’s largest industries excites you, we'd love to chat.

### Job Description
You write a lot of Javascript, on the client and the server. You might have mobile experience. You’re rock-solid in two domains (maybe more), edge-cases included. A quality code review is something you feel like you know how to do and thinking in systems-level and fullstack terms comes naturally at this point for you.
Reactive frameworks, such as React, Vue, and Meteor are comfortable for you.  Discussing technical trade-offs, and articulating them to everyone at the table, are things you can do.
Working on a small, fast-paced team (8 currently) excites you, and you feel that you can bring good habits while still writing code quickly to a fast-growing, sharp team.
This wouldn’t be your first Node shop.

### What you’ll do
+	You will be primarily responsible for writing client code, browser and mobile, breaking down acceptance criteria into tasks you then implement.  You’ll also get to work on the backend API and other parts of the stack and should be comfortable working with a database.
+	Contributing in sprint planning, grooming stories, designing and documenting code, and mentoring or brown-bags are all things you’ll be doing often.
+	You’ll get to take sizeable features from start to finish, and you like to play board and card games with us at lunch.

### What we look for
+	5+ years javascript
+	5-8 years overall industry experience
+	Worked in a production nodejs shop previously
+	Prior experience with React, or reactive data frameworks (vue, meteor, ember, etc.)
+	Equally comfortable with backend and frontend (node & css)

### Bonus Points
+	Experience with React Native, Docker, iOS, and PostgreSQL
