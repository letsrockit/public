## Mobile Engineer (iOS) 
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
People spend 4 hours a day consuming content on their mobile phones and at our company, we’d like to fundamentally change how people share interesting moments from their digital world. We let you record a 15-second video reaction with overlays for your face and voice over anything you see on your phone from that awkward text message to your fav playlist to crazy news. Instagram and Snapchat have built massive networks around the front and back cameras of your phone. We pioneered mobile screen capture and are building a social network for the third camera on your phone: the screen. We’re a 25 person team and have landed $35M in funding.
You'll join a 3-person iOS team and own things from start to finish while taking our app to millions of users with lots of autonomy.

### What you'll do
+ Own all of the graphics related aspects of our screen recording and creation tools.
+ Build cool new innovative creation features that allow our users to make content they can’t create anywhere else in the world.
+ Work with the product and design team to plan and prioritize future app features.

### What we look for
+ Driven team player who doesn’t need hand-holding to get things done. We love folks that own things 110%.
+ Strong knowledge of OpenGL. You haven’t just used game engines before, you’ve written lots of raw OpenGL code from scratch and you dream of shaders in your sleep.
+ Experience with graphics on iOS using Metal and SceneKit.
+ “Close enough” doesn’t cut it at our company. We want people who obsess over user experience and pixel perfection.

### Bonus Points
+ Experience with GLKit and/or SpriteKit.
+ You've built and shipped quality iOS apps.
+ You are an expert with multi-threaded code. You eat race conditions for breakfast.

### Why choose us?
+ Our hiring bar is very high, so you’ll work with the brightest people in the industry.
+ Startup shenanigans like ping pong, nerf gun battles, game nights and bubble soccer.
+ Stipends for conferences, workshops, mobile games, books and more.
+ Catered lunch and dinner, in addition to a fully stocked snack pantry.
+ You’ll join at the ground level, move fast and make an immediate, measurable impact.
+ Recognized by San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal among "Best Places to Work in 2016".
