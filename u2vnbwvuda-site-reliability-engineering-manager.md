## Site Reliability Engineering Manager
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) are members of the engineering team whose primary goal is to ensure the reliability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of our production infrastructure.
While these responsibilities are shared with the entire engineering team, SREs build and maintain the portions of our stack that ensure the entire team can confidently ship software day in and day out. They complement other engineers with their deeper knowledge of the fundamental pieces of technology that underpin our production infrastructure. The SRE team are our in-house experts on building reliable, maintainable systems and they are responsible for setting the direction that determines how we go about constructing and deploying our production environment.

### Job Description
As a SRE Manager, you could lead projects like these: 
+	Build and maintain highly available distributed systems at scale, including our large deployments of Kafka and hundreds of containerized microservices spanning multiple regions
+	Troubleshoot and mitigate the thorniest problems in our most important systems
+	Optimize mission-critical services written in Go and Node
+	Automate the process of efficiently and cost-effectively handling capacity, safely deploying software, and mitigating failures.
+	Share with others through open source and spread your expertise through contributions to our Engineering blog.

### What we look for
+	You lead by example and care for your team.
+	You establish credibility with the quality of your and your team's technical execution.
+	You have a rare ability to collaborate with and influence diverse engineering teams to improve the reliability, scalability and durability of their services.
+	You know how to source, recruit, hire and retain talented SREs.
+	You mentor and develop each SRE to reach their full potential.
+	You give SREs the tools, confidence, and motivation to make decisions independently that lead to their personal and professional success.
+	You effectively coordinate response to outages and advise the team during postmortems on effectively avoiding repeated incidents.

### Requirements
+	Experience managing healthy and high-performing engineering teams, both technically and as a people manager. You understand the importance of laying out context for the team instead of prescribing solutions.
+	Experience managing an engineering team on large-scale projects with technical deep-dives into code, networking, operating systems and/or storage.
+	Previous operational responsibility for business critical production systems, in a collaborative environment.
+	Strong sense of urgency and ownership over critical problem areas.
+	CS, EE or CE degree and/or a demonstrable, solid understanding of CS fundamentals.
+	Solid grasp of Linux systems and networking concepts.
+	Excellent communicator; writes great documentation.

### Bonus Points
+	Experience operating large-scale, distributed systems on top of cloud infrastructure like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Compute Platform.
+	Broad understanding of the OS and of networking protocols with demonstrated ability to apply this understanding to solve real problems.
+	Strong proficiency with OS tuning and expertise in the application of debugging tools.
+	Expertise in problem solving and analyzing distributed systems at global scale.
