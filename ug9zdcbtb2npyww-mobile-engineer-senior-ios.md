We’re building a beautiful, open-source, scriptable messaging platform in the spirit of the web. People who've seen it say it combines the best of Twitter, Tumblr, and Slack. True to our values, we've made all of it scriptable—our sandboxed JavaScript execution environment runs on phones, desktops and the cloud. This goes way beyond bots: third party developers can succinctly customize and deploy new feed behavior and UI.

We are early contributors to Firefox and Chrome, Netflix and Yelp; led by a repeat founder. We've built and shipped browsers to billions of people and have scaled backend services as large as Google Search.

We believe that an open approach to a communication platform leads to a better future than one in which a handful of companies own the way in which we talk. We've seen how that turned out.

We work mostly distributed around the Bay Area and are nearing the end of our alpha. Now is the perfect time to join us.
