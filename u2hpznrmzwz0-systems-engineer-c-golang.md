## Systems Engineer (C/Golang)
#### Santa Clara, CA

### Overview
Software is eating the world! We are moving from a world of software artisans to an age where everyone is developing software and connecting it directly to the Internet (e.g., SaaS, IoT, self-driving cars, and mobile applications). The defense-in-depth architecture developed over the last 2 decades doesn't work for cloud based workloads. This needs a re-think - and it is a $15B+ opportunity today with analysts expecting this to be the fastest growing segment of security in the next decade. 

The Company is a stealth security startup that raised its Series-A from 2 top-tier investors in early 2017. The founding team has several luminaries: (a) Chief Product/Strategy officer of the hottest security IPO in the last 5 years, (b) early employee of several startups with successful exits, (c) open source contributors, and (d) PhDs with several hundred citations to their credit. 
If you have wanted to get in on the ground floor of an exciting opportunity to redefine security, this might be it!
