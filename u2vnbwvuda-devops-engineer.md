## DevOps Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We believe companies should be able to send their data wherever they want, whenever they want, with no fuss. We make this easy with a single platform that collects, stores and sends data to hundreds of business tools with the flip of a switch. Our goal is to make using data easy, and weâ€™re looking for people to join us on the journey. We are excited about building toward a world where engineers at other companies spend their time working on their core product, rather than spending nights and weekends tweaking their customer data into various formats for 3rd party tools.
Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) are members of the engineering team whose primary goal is to ensure the reliability, flexibility, and cost effectiveness of our production infrastructure.

While these responsibilities are shared with the entire engineering team, SREs build and maintain the portions of our stack that ensure the entire engineering team can confidently ship software day in and day out. They complement other engineers with their deeper knowledge of the fundamental pieces of technology that underpin our production infrastructure. The SRE team are our in-house experts on building reliable, maintainable systems and they are responsible for setting the direction that determines how we go about constructing and deploying our production environment.
