## Fullstack Engineer (Senior, Ruby)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company is a new type of VC with software at the core of its strategy. You will get to work with and learn from the four founders who have built large, successful software companies valued at $10B+. You'll be part of a team working on a broad range of products that are both externally and internally facing.
We’re looking for a full-stack developer to join our product team. If you are passionate about transforming how innovation gets funded through code - we want to meet you.

### What you’ll do
As a full-stack developer, you will play a key role in building out the software stack for products used by founders globally. Our goal is to both modernize and humanize how the VC ecosystem communicates and conducts business. Here are some of the interesting challenges we’ve been working on:
+	Our secret sauce is in helping members of the venture community (CEOs, investors, and advisors) leverage their networks. To do that, we need to know who knows who, and how well. How do we capture, store, and analyze tens of millions of email message headers to solve that problem?
+	We're aiming for our tool’s “BIG List” to be the world’s best directory of venture capitalists and angel investors. How do we combine technology and human intelligence to create a robust directory? And when those investors become its users, how do we reliably connect them with the information we've already collected to provide them a great first user experience (and avoid creating duplicate people)?
+	We've been building out a single page app in React with GraphQL (we were one of the very first apps to use the GraphQL/Apollo stack in production). We're proud that our website feels like using a native app. The patterns for working with this bleeding edge technology are emerging, and we're helping to figure them out!

### What we look for
+	You think and move quickly, and are excited about shipping new features several times daily 
+	You aren’t phased by rapidly changing requirements 
+	You want to learn new things (fast!), and bring new ideas and technology to the team 
+	You can think through the technical and product ramifications of a new feature, and see design (both code and product) challenges two steps ahead 

### Bonus points
+	Experience with the following: Ruby/Rails, React/Redux, GraphQL/Apollo, PostgreSQL, frontend testing 
+	Experience managing DevOps for a simple web app (Heroku, Webpack) 
+	Has launched a product on their own or with a small team
