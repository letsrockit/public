## Backend Engineer (Senior, Agnostic/Ruby/Python/Java) 
#### Redwood City, CA

### Overview
Our company instantly organizes the world’s social and digital signals by location, giving an unprecedented level of understanding of what’s happening anywhere in the world, in real time. Doing this involves bringing in and analyzing live data from hundreds of thousands of sources, amounting to hundreds of millions of records per day. We’re solving systems problems that no one else is tackling. We are looking for talented engineers to join our Platform engineering team to scale these systems even further. We are looking for engineers who are focused on performance, scale, and quality in everything they do. We move fast but also put a premium on precision. Our team members have diverse backgrounds but all of us share a passion for solving such challenges, and doing it on a small, agile team that means everyone has huge impact. 
### What you'll do
+ Work as part of a focused, committed team that values contribution from everyone and expects everyone to bring creative ideas to bear in solving some of the hardest technology problems in the industry.
+ Have an opportunity to work with data and technology seen nowhere else (seriously).
+ Develop, monitor, and maintain services that power our live understanding of what’s happening in the world. This includes systems that bring in real-time data from hundreds of thousands of sources, manage analysis of such data, and manage storage and propagation of that data to downstream products. 
### What we look for
+ Eagerness to tackle big problems that have unknown solutions at the outset.
+ Natural inclination to demand rigor in everything you build, even while building fast and adapting plans as we grow.
+ Inherent curiosity and ability to learn new technologies, plus the ability to figure out the best tools for a given problem. We don’t suffer from ‘Not Invented Here’ syndrome and try hard to use the best tool for the job.
+ Focus on using data and objective, empirical methods to understand where we are and how to improve.
+ Experience working on small, fast-moving, high capability teams.
+ Experience designing and leading important systems software projects, using modern languages and technologies. We don’t care as much about any one specific piece of technology expertise as with your ability and experience solving hard problems.
+ Some of the best engineers we know had backgrounds that did not include college degrees in Computer Science or related fields. We care a lot more about how you work and your abilities than your academic background.
