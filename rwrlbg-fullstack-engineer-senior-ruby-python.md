## Fullstack Engineer (Senior, Python/Ruby)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company is building the platform for office services. We’re looking for fantastic engineers who can work harder, faster, and smarter without sacrificing technical excellence. Our organizational challenges are unique, and we are rapidly defining an enormous new industry, so you should be excited to build systems that can support the way that the office will run in the future

### Job description
As a full-time Senior Software Engineer, you'll have a direct impact on the customer experience and on-site experience. We are ambitious, engaged and excited about building the most innovative services platform of all time. Unlike most technology companies, we touch people from all ways of life, and our company has both a digital and physical product in our technology and people.

### What you'll do
+ Own and ship new features from the database to the front-end.
+ Build plumbing to connect to 3rd-party APIs.
+ Contribute to our technical architecture.  We're building libraries that make it easier and faster to ship features with fewer bugs.
+ Instrument new features and use that data to drive iteration.
+ Translate high-level product goals and user feedback into solutions.
+ Opportunity to contribute to our infrastructure and testing stack.

### What we look for
+ Bachelors, Masters or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical discipline.
+ Experience in at least one scripting language (e.g. Ruby or Python) 
+ Demonstrated software engineering experience through previous work experience, coding competitions, and/or publications.
+ Fast learner – We’re looking for software engineers who thrive on learning new technologies and want to build something that will be used by many. You should be able to adapt easily to meet the needs of our massive growth and rapidly evolving business environment. You have advanced knowledge of at least one scripting language (e.g. Ruby or Python) and knowledge of or eagerness to learn: PostgreSQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch.
+ Attention-to-Detail – You strive to prove that speed and quality are not conflicting; you can achieve both at the same time.
+ Versatility – In addition to having an intimate knowledge of the whole web stack, you understand how all the pieces fit together (front-end, database, network layer, etc.) and how they impact the performance of your application.
+ Passion – You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code "released" until you’re confident it’s correct. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage. You have sound judgment.
+ Team player – You believe that you can achieve more on a team than you ever could alone. You rely and thrive on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement.
+ Design and business acumen – You understand requirements beyond the written word. Whether you’re working on an API used by other developers, an internal tool consumed by our operation teams, or a feature designed for thousands of customers, your attention to details leads to a delightful user experience.

### Perks
+ Ground floor opportunity with the team; shape the strategic direction of a fast-growing Y Combinator startup 
+ Be part of a company that uniquely leverages technology to empower a diverse range of people, from our on-site Wizards to our individual clients 
+ Fun office environment 
+ Competitive salary 
+ Full benefits (medical, dental, vision) 
+ Generous stock options 
+ Daily lunch in the office + snacks 
+ Lyft / Uber reimbursements 
+ 401(k) contribution opportunity 
+ Cool swag 
+ Great location in the SOMA district of SF
