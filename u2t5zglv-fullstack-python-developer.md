You are currently viewing the public repo, which is limited in that company details have been ommitted in this job description.  
    
We understand that this is less than ideal.  We are, for various reasons, unable to publicize the companies we work with, so we've
created a **private un-anonymized repository** which is much more informative on who these companies are and what they're hiring for.
