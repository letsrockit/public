## Frontend Engineer (Javascript)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We believe companies should be able to send their data wherever they want, whenever they want, with no fuss. We make this easy with a single platform that collects, stores, filters, transforms, and sends data to hundreds of business tools with the flip of a switch. Our goal is to make it easy to understand, extract value, and protect the integrity of data. We are creating a world where engineers spend their time working on their core product, letting us take care of the complexities of processing their customer data reliably at scale. We’re in the running to take over the entire customer data ecosystem, and we need the best people to take the market.

### Job Description
We have a number of exciting projects. Here’s a few that stick out:
+	Build a new major product — the Data Catalog. Customers send us an Order Completed event, and we calculate average_order_size for every user automatically
+	Build a new major product — Functions. Customers can write code within our app, and we’ll execute it every time 
+	Upgrade our web collection library analytics.js (used by tens of thousands of companies) to fetch Personas profile data within milliseconds of page load.

### What we look for
+	You can write both client side and server side JavaScript using the latest APIs and language features.
+	You have some familiarity with Golang or are excited to learn it.
+	Minimum of 3 years of industry experience in engineering or some cool projects on GitHub you think we'll love to check out.
+	You show evidence of exposure to architectural patterns of high-scale web application (e.g., well-designed APIs, high volume data pipelines, efficient algorithms.)
+	You are confident understanding and editing large application data models to ship new products. 
+	You thrive in a fast paced and iterative environment. You are driven more by customer impact then technology.
