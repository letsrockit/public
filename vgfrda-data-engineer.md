### What we look for
+ Profound and extensive experience with cluster computing frameworks; we work with Spark and Scala
+ Strong programming skills in at least one language; functional languages (Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Erlang) are preferred
+ Significant experience with SQL and NoSQL databases
+ Demonstrated experience with cloud platforms, such as AWS

### Bonus Points
