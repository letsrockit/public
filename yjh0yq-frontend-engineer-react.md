## Frontend Engineer (React)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are a software­powered retailer designed to make physical retail accessible for all. We help people discover, try, and learn about new tech products in real life while empowering makers with a simple retail­as­a­service model that puts them in control. Simply put, we’re a brand­new store for brand­new technology, and we focus as much on the maker’s experience as we do the customer’s. 
### Job Description
We’re focused on user experience - both for our customers and our product makers. As a front­end engineer, you’ll play a pivotal role in translating this desire into applications that our customers
interact with. You have a strong desire to ship stunning UX in pixel ­perfection and build applications that stand the test of your peers (and time). Ideally, we’re looking for a seasoned engineer with experience building production­ready applications. We’re looking for an experienced front­end engineer to work within our small but growing engineering team. Our front­end team is responsible for crafting and maintaining software for our
platform, ranging from client­facing applications, in­store services, and internal tools - all written in React (or React Native) using technologies such as Jest, Flow, CSS Modules, Webpack, and Redux

### What you'll do
+ Collaborate with our team to build and maintain client­side Javascript (React) web applications.
+ Design testable, maintainable, and scalable application architecture to support the development of complex web applications.
+ Integrate with back­end services.
+ Work closely with product managers and product designers to deliver outstanding user­experience with obsessive attention to detail.
+ Make great UX decisions in the absence of complete specifications. 
### What we look for
+ Passion for hardware, retail, commerce, or ad tech.
+ Not less than 3 years of industry experience as a front­end engineer (a.k.a. UX engineer, front­end developer)
+ Fluent in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript—demonstrated ability to write scalable, well­architected CSS and Javascript.
+ Experience developing a medium­to­large, complex web application.
+ Demonstrated proficiency implementing responsive design.
+ Awareness of cross­browser compatibility issues and client­side performance considerations.
+ Excellent attention to detail and demonstrated strong design and UX sensibilities.
