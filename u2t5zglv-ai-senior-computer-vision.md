## AI (Senior, Computer Vision)
#### Atherton, CA

### Company Overview
Combined with the inexpensive image sensors and processors in mobile phones, our computer vision and motion planning algorithms give drones the ability to navigate intelligently with respect to their surroundings. This will deliver more usability, reliability, and capability for the emerging drone market. We believe this represents a platform scale opportunity, and our goal is to be the navigation solution that manufacturers, service providers, and their end users rely on.

### Job Description
The core of our system is the computer vision algorithms that allow drones to understand the world around them. We’re looking for people who bring together an understanding of the relevant theory, solid software skills, and an ability to drive through to working solutions. You’ll help architect and implement the algorithms that run on every drone we make.

+	Design and implement real-time estimation and mapping algorithms
+	Characterize and quantify the performance of the vision system
+	Research and prototype new approaches
+	Be a generalist helping out on all aspects of the system when needed

### Qualifications
+	Hands on experience with visual odometry, mapping, and slam
+	Proficiency with probabilistic inference and 3d geometry
+	Demonstrated capability to push the state of the art forward in relevant domains
+	Solid software engineering foundation and a commitment to writing clean, well architected code
+	High proficiency in C++
+	Thrive in a fast paced, collaborative, small team environment

We’re looking for people who want to help create the future of flying machines. If you thrive in a fast paced, collaborative environment and are looking for a long lever for your skills we want to hear from you. Expect to be issued a personal drone on your first day for you to explore and experience the power of the technology as you see fit.
