## Fullstack Engineer (Agnostic/Python/Javascript) 
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are building the software layer that powers all biological research. Our customers are solving humanity’s most pressing challenges, such as disease, renewable energy, clean water, and hunger. We enable them to collaborate and move more efficiently.

Research today means disparate tools, manual data entry, and lots of paper. We provide a streamlined system for designing and running experiments, analyzing data, and sharing results. Scientists are able to work much faster while organizations can collect and tap into their vast institutional knowledge.

We're looking for experienced software engineers to join our small, highly talented team.

### What you'll do
+ Design and implement intricate systems and user workflows under tight deadlines.
+ Own projects end-to-end, from developing prototypes to ensuring reliable roll-outs to large organizations.
+ Communicate clearly and constantly with designers and other engineers.
+ Help rapidly scale our product and team.

### What we look for
+ BS/MS in Computer Science or equivalent.
+ 3-5 years experience in software engineering.
+ Strong abilities in programming, algorithms, and web infrastructure.
+ Passionate about working on interesting problems and product ownership.
+ Interested in learning more about life science.
+ Excited to build a team that is both culturally and technically exceptional

### Why choose us?
+ We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
