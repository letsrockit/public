#### Redwood City, CA

### The Pitch (About the role)
Founded in 2009, our company is an industry-disrupting, cloud-based customer communication platform that solves the challenges of reliably delivering emails on behalf of our customers. We deliver over 30 billion emails a month for customers like Airbnb, Spotify, and Uber.

Our Manager of Software Engineering will be a dynamic and inspiring software product development leader with a passion for managing, mentorship, and influential leadership. The Manager of Software Engineering will grow and lead one of our talented engineering teams, facilitate Agile methodologies and

Your primary responsibilities will be to hire great people, mentor through regular feedback, and lead the team to consistently deliver. You should also be able to dig in and solve hard technical problems and provide deep technical guidance. To succeed in this role, you will have a passion for Agile software development, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation, and possess a strong background in the SaaS or PaaS space.
