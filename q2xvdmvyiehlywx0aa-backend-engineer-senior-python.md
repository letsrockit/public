### Overview
Our company is transforming the healthcare industry utilizing modern data analytics platforms to provide customized preventative health plans by identifying gaps in their members’ care. Unlike other competing health insurance companies that strive to practice preventative care, Clover focuses on helping Medicare members with tailored technology they built from scratch. Clover directly involves doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners into their system to provide them with actionable information that helps their patients prevent acute health episodes.

You are willing and able to help your teammates grow by demonstrating best practices, providing (and receiving) respectful and constructive feedback, and sharing your unique insights with everyone.
