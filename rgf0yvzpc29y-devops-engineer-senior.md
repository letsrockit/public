## DevOps Engineer (Senior)
#### Mountain View, CA

### Overview
Our company is a next generation security company that utilizes industry leading unsupervised machine learning to detect fraudulent activity for financial transactions, mobile user acquisition, social networks, commerce and money laundering. Our solution is used by some of the largest internet properties in the world, including Yelp, Pinterest, Momo, King and IGG, to protect them from the ever-increasing risk of fraud. Our award-winning software is powered by a team of world-class experts in big data, security, and scalable infrastructure. Our culture is open, positive, collaborative, and results driven. Come join us!
The Infrastructure team is the backbone of our company. Without our distributed and highly robust systems, business would stop. We tackle important challenges: clients require sub-second response times while we find relationships in terabytes of data. We’ve created, and continually improve, our massive cluster infrastructure, allowing highly computationally expensive jobs to run smoothly. We love using and learning about the latest technologies such as Spark, YARN, and Docker. We’re excellent software engineers building new infrastructure for our clients as well as other engineering teams within the company.

### Job Description
As a DevOps Engineer you will be part of the team that manages releases and deploys to a global, multi-cloud footprint. You are responsible for automating our code deployment and infrastructure management process, and for helping us scale to real-time responses with huge client datasets. You will be instrumenting monitors to ensure that our systems adhere to the strictest of SLA, and help us reduce our cost footprint by optimizing the way our Spark jobs run across multiple cloud providers globally.
