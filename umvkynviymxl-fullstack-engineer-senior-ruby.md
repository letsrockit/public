## Fullstack Engineer (Senior, Ruby) 
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We begin with the world’s largest collection of artist shops. A shirt with an evil cat. An iPhone case with a hipster pirate. Whatever your thing, we have an uncommon design that smacks you right in the heart. (All available on over 60 products.) As for us? We’re passionate, imaginative, and a little offbeat. An inspired mix that’s helped artists earn over fifty million since launch. (We’re also nice, well-balanced folks with lives outside of work.)  Founded in Melbourne, Australia, our company now has main offices in the Central Business District of Melbourne, the SOMA area of San Francisco, and our newest office in Berlin!

### Job Description
We have recently broken ground on a new technology team, in the heart of San Francisco. As a Senior Fullstack Engineer, you will be involved in every step of the development process. Our SF Engineering team is a small, collaborative team dedicated to enhancing the possibilities and experiences for our customers, our artists and our partners. Our full-stack developers in SF will enjoy the agility and dynamism often found at startups combined with the stability typically found at larger, well-positioned organizations. Your contributions will be critical in setting the stage as we scale for global growth and launch new products. Like to travel? Visiting our Australian offices are a perk you’d get to enjoy. So, get ready for takeoff and get ready for your next great challenge.
