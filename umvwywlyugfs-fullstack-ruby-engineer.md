## Fullstack Ruby Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

### Quick Summary
We are located in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco close to Bart, CalTrain, and the Third Street Rail. We are a diverse team of experienced product, engineering, and auto professionals, and while we work intensely and care deeply about our work, we also respect that you have a life outside of work.

###Job Description
Be a senior software engineer in our venture backed startup, bringing transparency and user delight to the $100 billion car repair industry. You don't need to know anything about cars but you do have to care about helping consumers.

We're a team of full stack engineers using mainly Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Mysql, and Postgresql to make the consumer car repair experience awesome.

### What we look for
You should be excited about using AB tests, cucumber, capybara, and rspecs to build and release high quality software daily, capable of managing your own small to medium sized releases, and should enjoy collaborating with and supporting your peers.
