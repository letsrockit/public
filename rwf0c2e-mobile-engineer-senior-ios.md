## Mobile Engineer (Senior, iOS)

### Quick Summary 
This Company was founded to make a transformative impact by delivering on the promise of Quinoa as the solution to a smarter, more sustainable food supply. The world’s food system is challenged – highly inefficient in its resource utilization and delivering fundamentally unhealthy food to consumers. Through the use of food and sensory science to guide the creation of better food, and software and data science to engineer a new type of fast food experience, we are expanding the prominence and accessibility of an alternative that is better for people and better for the planet. We see an opportunity to innovate within a $4.7 trillion industry that has seen little technology advancement. One of the primary reasons these e-commerce platforms have seen such success is their deep data-driven understanding of every customer.
