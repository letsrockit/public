## Fullstack Engineer (Lead, Python)
##### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
Our company is a data-driven financial technology company. Machine learning is core to our decision making processes, from validating identities and detecting fraud, to credit underwriting and servicing. We seek to revolutionize the credit system by building higher quality alternatives to incumbent systems and methods.

### Job Description
We’re looking for an engineer to lead the full stack (web frontend and backend) development on projects to improve and grow our app.
The team you’ll join is responsible for new product initiatives at the company that go beyond our core business in the value they provide to our customers. Part of this mandate is to invest in our app offering which provides powerful search and discovery tools that let customers find relevant themes, categories, merchants and discounts where they can save money and use financing. The team’s work is a critical part of our mission to become a trusted financial partner for our customers, and to help them live their best and most fulfilling financial lives. You can think of the team as R&D or a “startup within a startup” working on the next generation of our products.

### What you'll do
+ Lead technical projects from specification and planning, through execution & coding with multiple engineers, to testing and deployment into production
+ Design and implement new product features, as well as extend core platform services and APIs to support those features
+ Architect and build the web frontend for our app offering
+ Analyze/debug performance issues on the frontend and across distributed services
+ Plan, design, and build our core platform software and systems to scale with an increasing number of users, features, business requirements, partners, and new engineers
+ Provide mentoring to more junior engineers in their progress on business and personal career goals

### What we look for
+ Passion and drive to change consumer finance for the better
+ Experience building real-time distributed web services in the Consumer or SaaS space
+ Ability to pick up new technologies quickly
+ Strong software engineering fundamentals are far more important than familiarity with specific tools or languages
+ Emphasis on writing clear, readable, testable code

### Nice to Haves
+ Experience working on growth hacking projects
+ Interest in or experience with recommendation systems
+ Python expertise

### Why choose us?
At our company, we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.

We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say "I trust my bank to look out for me". It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem.

We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.
