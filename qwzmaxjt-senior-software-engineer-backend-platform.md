## Senior Software Engineer - Backend Platform
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We’re looking for an engineer to lead the backend development on a new strategic project that aims to deliver actionable insights to our users based on their financial data.

The team you’ll join is responsible for new product initiatives at our company that provide value to our customers on a weekly or even daily basis. Part of this mandate is to build a future-facing cash flow management app that will help our users understand their obligations and other cash flows in the context of the rest of their finances. The team’s work is a critical part of company’s mission to become a trusted financial partner for our customers, and to help them with all aspects of their financial lives. You can think of the team as R&D or a “startup within a startup” working on the next generation of our products.

### What you will do
+	Lead technical projects from specification and planning, through execution & coding with multiple engineers, to testing and deployment into production
+	Design, implement, and extend core platform services and APIs to enable new products and features to be built
+	Architect and build the next version of our third party bank data ingestion pipeline
+	Analyze/debug performance issues across distributed services
+	Plan, design, and build our core platform software and systems to scale with an increasing number of users, features, business requirements, partners, and new engineers
+	Provide mentoring to more junior engineers in their progress on business and personal career goals

### What we look for
+	Passion and drive to change consumer finance for the better
+	Experience building real-time distributed web services in the Consumer of SaaS space
+	Ability to pick up new technologies quickly
+	Strong software engineering fundamentals are far more important than familiarity with specific tools or languages
+	Emphasis on writing clear, readable, testable code

### Nice to haves
+	Experience working with low to medium fidelity third party data APIs
+	Interest in or experience with heuristic modeling
+	Python expertise

### Why choose us?
We are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.
We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say "I trust my bank to look out for me". It doesn’t have to be this way, and it’s our mission to fix this problem.
We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO of PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.
