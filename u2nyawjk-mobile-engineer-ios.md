### Overview
Our engineering team is growing rapidly and we’re looking for an experienced engineering manager to help guide and develop the iOS team.

They rely on their leadership to increase productivity by removing obstacles and keeping processes lean. As a manager, your job is to keep your team efficient and executing on the right goals, to meet the needs of both the product and the engineers.
