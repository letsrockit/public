### Overview
Social media has been great at keeping us in touch with everyone, but are we truly together? We believe that there’s a new movement in connectedness coming. A new social system in the digital world that can actually help us feel closer to those who matter most in our lives. Where real friends can share real moments in real time. This is an opportunity at a global scale, and one that is the next logical step in the way we communicate, share, talk, and spend time together online.

That’s why we are pioneering a new social experience, designed for togetherness. It’s an intimate space for people to share conversations and content in real time. A place for us to truly be together. 

Our company is built on some amazing new technology crafted by a world-class team of brainiacs in Palo Alto and New York City. We're well-funded, running at full sprint, and looking for extraordinary people to join us on this exciting adventure!
