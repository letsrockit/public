## Backend Engineer
#### San Francisco, CA

Our mission is building the impossible: a next-gen communications platform to make professional communications as rich, interactive, and developer-friendly as the web. We’re looking for talented full-stack engineers to join us in this mission.
We’re a distributed & international team, so if you’re looking to work with us remotely, we encourage you to apply!

### What will I be working on?

Imagine you’re laying tracks as the train is barreling down towards you: fully loaded and going 200mph. What do you do: Stop and plan your next 25 miles of track? Or hastily throw some iron on the ground now? Or something in between?
As a backend engineer, you’ll make decisions that span this reaches of this spectrum every day. You’ll balance time, features, and quality to get the right solution out right now. This might include patching our email sending service to deal with a temporary SMTP failure code, or it might mean designing the communications architecture that will replace email. We’ll leave it largely up to you to evolve the stack as you see fit. We eagerly participate in open source development and will encourage you to do the same.

### What you might work on:
+	Design, write and deliver software to improve the availability, scalability, latency, and efficiency of our microservices.
+	Scale our backend service to send many millions of messages a day
+	Maintain an elastic distributed infrastructure built on top of AWS
+	Solve problems relating to mission-critical services and build automation to prevent problem recurrence, with the goal of automating response to all non-exceptional service conditions
+	Build large scale data processing pipelines for indexing content
+	Continuously find opportunities to refactor, improve performance, and increase reliability & quality

Core technologies: ES6, Backbone, NodeJS, Jasmine, Express, Mongo, Redis, Meteor, Electron, Meteor Galaxy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, S3, Cloudwatch.

### What are you looking for in a team member?
Your specialization is less important than your ability to learn fast and adapt to shifting technologies. We’re especially fond of people who:

+	Focus on project goals, not just writing code.
+	Iterate until customers love what you’ve built, and pay for it.
+	Have a hacker mindset and master the fine art of balancing time, features, and quality of code. You know when to unit test and when to “just ship it”.
+	Strive to grow personally and professionally, beyond just expanding technical abilities.
+	Love to experiment with new technology and share knowledge with the team.
+	Represent the team and product at conferences.

If you are a member of an under-represented group in technology, we strongly encourage you to apply.

### What’s it like to work with us?
We’re a driven, passionate, responsible group who values personal and professional growth equally. We take care of ourselves, our families, our customers and one another. We believe in sustainable and diverse approaches to work and life, because optimizing for the long-term is the best path to success. As a team, we built multi-million dollar products with this balance in mind.
As a founding team member, you’ll wear multiple hats, embrace ambiguity, and take charge leading complex projects. You’ll have the support of an experienced team who’ve built multi-million dollar products and services. This is exceptionally challenging work, but will be the most meaningful and rewarding of your career.

Our office is in San Francisco near Caltrain. We offer competitive compensation and benefits. You’ll work with a great team on a product people love!
