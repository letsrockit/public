## Fullstack Engineer (node.js)
#### San Francisco, CA

### Overview
We are a digital nutrition platform that takes the guesswork out of healthy eating with personalized meal recommendations based on biometrics and food preferences. We work with employers, health plans and wellness companies to reduce chronic disease and improve the health of their employees and members. Our solution delivers real-time support for all the places a person makes food decisions – at home, at work, at the grocery story, and at restaurants. Pointing users to the healthiest recipe and menu choices reduces the likelihood of making poor food choices based on convenience, cost and other factors.
We're on a mission to reduce chronic disease by making it easy to eat well. Are you ready to join our team and make a difference?

### About you
We are looking to take our first steps into going global. As such, we are looking for a senior engineer with platform cross cutting product experience in the areas of i18n/l10n. Web content accessibility experience is also a big plus. This is a ground floor type position and not intended for everyone. If you are most comfortable when prescribed work, stop reading any further as this role is not for you.
However, if you enjoy the challenge, freedom and satisfaction that comes from both planning out and then executing on strategy, then this is the role for you. Leveraging your experience in internationalization and localization, you will be given ownership of company’s playbook on how we take our product and tech to a global audience. Attention to detail is second nature for you and you’ve done enough projects to instinctively know what works, and what doesn’t. You want to be part of a fast-moving startup environment. You have a personal interest in health and wellness and can get behind our mission.

What you'll do
+	Lead the effort to upgrade our web app and services to support multi-locale and multi-language operation
+	Develop l10n tooling and utilities for developer productivity
+	Evangelize and train other engineers, product managers and designers on i18n/l10n best practices

What we look for
+	Prior experience with i18n/l10n engineering and best practices
+	Strong Node.js skills and expert knowledge of JavaScript
+	Broad knowledge of frameworks (we use Hapi.js, Bookshelf.js, React.js, Backbone.js, Zurb Foundation and more!)
+	Experienced with ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3
+	Strong MySQL background and knowledge of REST API architectures
+	Experience with MVC architecture
+	Love to collaborate with product and design teams
+	Solid communication skills; know how to explain the same technical concepts to both engineers and non-engineers
+	Detail-oriented, motivated and a self-starter who can work without supervision
+	Degree in Computer Science or related technical discipline (or equivalent)

Bonus Points
+	Experience in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
+	Experience with Redux and Flux architecture
+	Fluency in another language
